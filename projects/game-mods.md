Mods are user-created content for games which can introduce new and/or modify existing game content. Modding was my introduction to programming, and here I discuss some of the largest and most popular mods I've written for two games.

## Factorio <a href="https://factorio.com" class="game-link-orange" target="_blank">website</a>

I've developed several mods for Factorio, written in Lua. [CJs QoL Research](https://github.com/cj-sz/CJsQualityOfLifeResearch01) has accumulated over 50,000 total downloads, and introduces new research options offering various quality-of-life improvements (increased movement speed, more inventory slots, etc). [CJs Infinite Ores](https://github.com/cj-sz/CJsInfiniteOres) offers support for customizing ore patch and oil field refill to the desired interval and richness, and has accumulated over 5,000 downloads.

## Startup Company <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/606800/Startup_Company/" class="game-link-orange" target="_blank">steam</a>

Startup Company is a 2020 business simulation game where you build and manage a tech startup. I developed the [Boss Suite](https://github.com/cj-sz/BossSuite/) of mods in JavaScript, consisting of the following:

- **Boss Beginner Extensions**: massively overhauls early game recipes through 18 new components for the Designer, Developer, Lead Developer, and Sys Admin at the Beginner level

- **Boss Intermediate Extensions**: further expands mid-game recipes with 16 new components for the above four positions at Intermediate level

- **Boss Expert Extensions**: expands endgame recipes with 11 new components for the above four positions at Expert level

- **Boss Components and Modules**: adds 30 new module components across most employee types and further overhauls recipes

- **Boss Marketing**: adds 9 new components to the Marketing chain

- **Boss SysAdmin Components and Updated Racks**: adds 13 new components to the SysAdmin production chains

These mods overhaul all of the base game recipes. I designed custom theme-fitting graphics for all of these components; below are some examples of original components in the game, and some of the sprites I created.
